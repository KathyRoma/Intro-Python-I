"""
Python tuples are sort of like lists, except they're immutable and
are usually used to hold heterogenous data, as opposed to lists
which are typically used to hold homogenous data. Tuples use
parens instead of square brackets.
More specifically, tuples are faster than lists. If you're looking
to just define a constant set of values and that set of values
never needs to be mutated, use a tuple instead of a list.
Additionally, your code will be safer if you opt to "write-protect"
data that does not need to be changed. Tuples enforce immutability
automatically.
"""

# Example:

import math

def dist(a, b):
    """Compute the distance between two x,y points."""
    x0, y0 = a  # Destructuring assignment
    x1, y1 = b

    return math.sqrt((x1 - x0)**2 + (y1 - y0)**2)

a = (2, 7)   # <-- x,y coordinates stored in tuples
b = (-14, 72)

# Prints "Distance is 66.94"
print("Distance is: {:.2f}".format(dist(a, b)))



# Write a function `print_tuple` that prints all the values in a tuple

def print_tuple(t):
    for num in t:
        print(num)

t = (1, 2, 5, 7, 99)

Python exposes a terse and intuitive syntax for performing 
slicing on lists and strings. This makes it easy to reference
only a portion of a list or string. 
This Stack Overflow answer provides a brief but thorough
overview: https://stackoverflow.com/a/509295
Use Python's slice syntax to achieve the following:
"""

a = [2, 4, 1, 7, 9, 6]

# Output the second element: 4:
print(a[1])

# Output the second-to-last element: 9
print(a[-2])

# Output the last three elements in the array: [7, 9, 6]
print(a[-3:])

# Output the two middle elements in the array: [1, 7]
print(a[2:4])

# Output every element except the first one: [4, 1, 7, 9, 6]
print(a[1:])

# Output every element except the last one: [2, 4, 1, 7, 9]
print(a[:-1])

# For string s...

s = "Hello, world!"

# Output just the 8th-12th characters: "world"

List comprehensions are one cool and unique feature of Python.
They essentially act as a terse and concise way of initializing
and populating a list given some expression that specifies how
the list should be populated.

for more info regarding list comprehensions.
